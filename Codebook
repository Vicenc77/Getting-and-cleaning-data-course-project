#Codebook: the following is a list describing the variables.

    # Dataset: dataset downloaded and extracted under "UCI HAR Dataset"
    # Features: assigned from "features.txt" dataset file
    # Data_train_x: assigned from "X_train.txt" dataset file
    # data_train_activity: assigned from "y_train.txt" dataset file
    # data_train_subject: assigned from "subject_train.txt" dataset file
    
    # data_train: assigned as a result of applying the "data.frame" function on 3 previous declared variables: data_train_subject, data_train_activity, and data_train_x
    
    # data_test_x: assigned from "X_test.txt" dataset file
    # data_test_activity: assigned from "y_test.txt" dataset file
    # data_test_subject: assigned from "subject_test.txt" dataset file
    
    # data_test: assigned as a result of applying the "data.frame" function on 3 previous declared variables:data_test_subject, data_test_activity and data_test_x
    
    # data_all : variable resulting from applying a "row bind" function to merge data_train and data_test
    
    # mean_std_select : variable resulting from applying the "grep" function to find whether 'mean' or 'std'
    
    # data_sub: resulting from extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
    
    # activity_labels: assigned from "activity_labels.txt" dataset file
    
    # name_new: variable resulting from appropriately labeling the data set with #descriptive variable names by means of the "gsub" function (e.g. "Gyro" for #"Gyroscope", etc.)
    
    # data_tidy: independent txt file resulting from tidying data on the previous steps,     # with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
